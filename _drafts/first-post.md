<p class="standout">Early in my career I knew that I wanted to write. Like many young developers, I would read my web heroes’ blogs as explored ideas and shared code, and thought "Yes, I want to do that too!"</p>

And now our world is flush with tutorials, code snippets, design theory, best practices, experimental techniques... And nearly all of it completely free of cost. How many of us grew up in the profession primarily through blog posts, conference videos, and podcasts? I sure did.

**The greatest accomplishment of the web development community is its endless imperative to share.** It's unbelievable the resources we freely make available to one another, through blog posts, tutorials, and open-source software.

For years I’ve sat back and enjoyed the benefit this sharing. But now I'm ready to jump in and contribute. I want to give back to the community that's given so much to me.

So here it is: a blog. It's not original. It's not particularly exciting. But it's a start.


Hello, world.
