<p class="standout">Early in my career, I desperately wanted to be famous. My web heroes seemed like movie stars and I followed them religiously. I dreamt of being just like them, at the forefront of the industry with the respect and admiration of my&nbsp;peers.</p>

I've matured a lot since then. These days I understand the value of taking pride in the work I produce, regardless of how many people see it.

Still, somewhere inside that youthful admiration was a core that I think many web developers have in common: a desire to talk about something we deeply care about. And in fact, I'm sure that's the same motivation that led my heroes to the place they were at. They weren't *trying* to be stars. They just took the extra step to talk about what they loved.

Our world is flush with tutorials, code snippets, design theory, best practices, experimental techniques... And nearly all of it completely free of cost. How many of us grew up in this profession on blog posts, conference videos, and podcasts? I sure did.

**The greatest accomplishment of the web development community is its endless imperative to share.** For years now Iâ€™ve lived on the edge of this world, enjoying the benefits. But now I'm ready to jump in and contribute. I want to give back to the community that's given so much to me.
