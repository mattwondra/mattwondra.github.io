I never wanted to build websites. I wanted to make video games. We all did.

That’s why my friends and I spent our 6th-grade lunch hour huddled around a TI-82 graphing calculator. We knew those tiny machines could run games, so were deperately trying to learn TI-BASIC. *By trial and error*.

None of us had really coded before. But someone's older brother did this kind of thing, so how hard could it be? We’d toss in keywords and commands almost at random, then run the program and see what happened. It was a complete mess. I remember nicknaming `for` loops “timewasters,” because without knowing how to harness the incrementing variable, all they seemed to do was pause the program execution.

In the end we never built our video game. But that was the start for me. I discovered that I could take this calculator and *make it do something*.

<!-- As we learned to fill up the screen with dots, add numbers, and implement the most basic logic imaginable, I remember a distinct feeling -->
