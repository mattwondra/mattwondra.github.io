    <h1 class="page-title">Hi. I’m Matt.</h1>

  <div class="page-content">
    <p class="standout">I’m a design-minded web geek living in Champaign, Illinois. Yes, we invented the web browser. Yes, you can be jealous.</p>
    <p>I work as a Front-End Web Developer with my amazing team at <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy</a> and <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com">The&nbsp;Kitchn</a>. Like a growing number of web teams, we operate remotely and I work from home. Most days it’s pretty great, but the upsides of remote work are offset by unique challenges&nbsp;too.</p>
    <p>On this site I write about my experiences in web design and development. It’s probably going to get pretty nerdy (sorry Mom). I’m also dipping my toes into <a href="/speaking.html">speaking publicly</a> on the topic. Hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/mattwondra">Twitter</a> if you’re looking for a presenter.</p>
    <p>At home I brew my own beer and usually it’s pretty drinkable, which is a bonus. I also like to find ridiculous icons, and <a href="http://iconsoutofcontext.tumblr.com/">occasionally post them to&nbsp;Tumblr</a>.</p>
