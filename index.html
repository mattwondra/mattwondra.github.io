  <h1 class="Page__title">Hi, I’m Matt.</h1>
  <p class="standout">I’m a design-minded web geek living in Champaign, Illinois. Yes, we invented the web browser. Yes, you can be jealous.</p>
</div>

<p>I work as Lead Front-End Web Engineer with my amazing team at <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy</a> and <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com">The&nbsp;Kitchn</a>. Like a growing number of web teams, we operate remotely and I work from home. Most days it’s pretty great, but the upsides of remote work are offset by unique challenges&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Someday I hope to find time to write here about my experiences in web design and development. It’s probably going to be pretty nerdy (sorry Mom). Once in a while I get the opportunity to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mattwondra/the-code-cure-small-steps-to-a-more-organized-front-end-codebase">speak</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattwondra/making-a-big-impact-with-a-small-web-team">publicly</a> on the topic. Hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/mattwondra">Twitter</a> if you’re looking for a&nbsp;presenter!</p>
<p>At home I brew my own beer and usually it’s pretty drinkable, which is a bonus. I also like to find ridiculous icons, and <a href="http://iconsoutofcontext.tumblr.com/">occasionally post them to&nbsp;Tumblr</a>.</p>
