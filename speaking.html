<p>
  I love discussing the web. Once in a while I even hop up on a stage and talk in
  front a big room full of people about it. (Yes, it's terrifying every time).
</p>
<p>
  These are some of the talks I've given. 
  If you're interested in terrifying me further by inviting me to speak on a web-related topic, hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/mattwondra">Twitter</a>.

<h2>The Code Cure: Small Steps to a More Organized Front-End Codebase</h2>
<p>
  Working with a clean codebase is like stepping into a well-organized space—it makes you feel right at home. But despit our best intentions, our front-end code has a tendency to get a bit... messy. It's ok, it happens to the best of us! Tight deadlines and one-off fixes can turn that tidy codebase into a dusty attic. The good news is, it isn't difficult to start taking back control. In this session, we'll look at practical, bite-sized assignments that you can accomplish at whatever pace your workflow allows. And together we can work towards a cleaner, more organized, and useful front-end codebase.

<h2>Making a Big Impact with a Small Web Team</h2>
<p>
  Let’s face it: Making a great website is a complicated task. Technical challenges, design considerations, and stakeholder expectations can quickly pile up into a seemingly endless backlog of bug reports, feature requests, and routine maintenance work. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, especially if you’re part of a small team. But working with a small team doesn’t have to be painful, and you can still do great work with just a few people.
